#Contributing Guide

<br>
## Introduction
=======
### Fermat Development Environment Installation and Configuration - Linux - Preferably ubuntu

Anybody can contribute to Fermat and you are welcome to do so. There is a stable community of mantainers called bitDubai. You might want to join this community and specifically one of their teams which are working on different areas of the system. Visit their [site](https://bitDubai.com) to learn how to join in.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Also, you might want to add your own functionality to Fermat, perhaps your own platform, plugins, reference wallet or build your own niche wallet. All of these options are covered within this guide.

Depending on where the changes you propose belogns to the procedure may vary a little bit. 

* **Git**
* **Java Standard Development Kit 7**
* **Gradle**
* **Android SDK Tools 23.01**
* **Android Development Studio or IntelliJ IDEA**

Although there are many ways to configure these tools, we'll provide you with a recommended configuration for your development environment.

## Part I: Casual Contribution

We consider a _casual contribution_ a bug fix or any other change big or small done in casual way, without assuming any responsability for the mantainance of the code submited.  _Casual contributions_ don't get to the size of adding new components to the system.


<br>
### Contributing to a Component

Whatever you find that can make Fermat better is welcome and it will be considered. Follow these steps to find the best way for your case: 

In fermat, every component (plugin, addon, library, etc) has a Author and a Mantainer.

1. Open www.fermat.org, go to the Architecture view and zoom in until you find the component you will suggest to change.
2. Click on that component to select it.
3. You will find there a picture of the author. If he/she is not the current mantainer, you will also find the mantainers picture. 
4. Click again their the picture to get more detailed info including their github username.
5. Go to https://github.com/*username*/fermat.

If your change don't need to be compiled and tested or you prefer not to do that yourself, then you can go through the _Casual or Minor Change_ section. Otherwise, if you prefer to get deeper and finish the job by yourself, then go throught the _Major Change_ section.

#### Casual or Minor Change

Find the file in *username*/fermat repo, open it on edit mode and hit  the "Propose file change" button when you are done.

#### Major Change

Fork the *username*/fermat repo, and submit a pull request there when done.


<br>
### Contributing to the Fermat Book

It is very easy to contribute to the book, just edit the desired file and at the end you will find the "Propose file change" button. Please do it at the editors' fork. You can find it [here](https://github.com/gustl-arg/fermat/tree/master/fermat-book).
