[[superlayers]]
== Chapter 4: Fermat Operating Systems Superlayer

NOTE: We call in Fermat *Superlayer* to a group of layers whose components offer services to be consumed system-wide, i.e. offering an infrastructure that hold the different *platforms* running over Fermat. (it is like a "common ground" where different "towers" (the platforms) are built, sharing basic level services )

This superlayer allows the connectivity of OS dependent components to the rest of Fermat multi-platform that is _OS independent_. The components offer the necessary functions to interact with the corresponding OS, like storing and retrieving information, managing files, managing user log-on, checking the device status, location, etc + 
Specific layers will be added as long as Fermat's releases include new OS. +
This low level layer allows to build on top in successive layers the components necessary to implement the *Desktop Applications* offered to Fermat  end users.

=== _Android layer_
In this layer, we find the different components to allow Fermat function on a device running Android. They are written in _android language_.
[horizontal]
File System :: it allows creation of files in a reserved memory area for each plug-in (it functions as a "private folder")
Database System :: it allows creation of a database only readable for the plug-in who owns it.  
Logger :: access to the OS activity log.
Device Location :: access to the GPS coordinates to determine device location.
Device Connectivity :: access to peripherals connecting to the device through USB Port / Bluetooh Port / etc.. 
Device Power ::
Device Contacts ::
Device Hardware:: information about the hardware of the device running the platform +

=== _Multi OS layer_
In this layer there are components that run in more than one OS at the time (Linux / MacOs / Windows). +
The components are similar to the other _OS layers_.
////
File System :: access to the file system
Database System :: access to plug-in proprietary databases +

=== _I-OS_ layer
(for further development) ...
