== Chapter 8: Fermat Plug-ins Platform

This platform encapsulates all the components that provide the basic services that build the back end infrastructure of Fermat framework. +
An essential identity introduced in this platform is the *device user identity*, which is only valid within a specific device, and its public part is never revealed. + 
There is also an *actor identity* introduced: the *plug-in developer identity* what is essential to this platform because it puts together  the basic functionalities that let Fermat function as a whole system, although it is made of distinct and separate components even created by different developers. +

Plug-ins are arranged in the corresponding layers described in the previous chapter, starting from _Platform Services layer_ at the bottom up to _Subapp layer_ at the top. 

////
=== _Platform Services layer_
In this platform, components in this layer handle exceptions and events: 

Event Manager :: it keeps track of the _events_ occurring alongside the entire platform to let plugins listen to the events that correspond to its function to trigger the corresponding plug-in activity. 

Connectivity Subsystem ::
Location Subsystem ::
Power Subsystem ::
Platform Info :: + 

=== _Hardware layer_
As Fermat runs distributed in different devices, this layer has the components necessary to identify each of this devices _independently_ of the user that is logged in, and also to provide all the device's information that is needed for the system to run.+

Local Device ::
Device Network :: +


=== _Users layer_
Fermat is a multiuser and multi-device system. Therefore, depending on how the user interacts with Fermat, users are divided into certain _users categories_ which allow to properly handle the user's activity within Fermat. +
 
Device User :: + this component handles transactions that take place inside the same device, an the user is identified in Fermat as a *Device User*


=== _Plug-in layer_
Identity ::
Dependency :: +


=== _License layer_
Fermat system ensures a _micro-license_ system to let the developer of a certain plug-in or certain wallet or any other component to charge a *fee* for the use of the component, and the revenue is enforced programmatically by Fermat to reach the license owner.

=== _Identity layer_
Developer :: gathers information about developers of components of Fermat, not only to identify his products, but also to give technical support.

=== Master Plan Phase II
Fermat foundations had been laid out by the five platforms and superlayers described in the previous chapters. Now let us enter the Phase II, where different platforms type are built: those to manage _crypto currencies_ and those for _digital assets_. +

._Crypto Currencies platforms_
. *Fermat Wallet Production & Distribution Platform*
. *Fermat Crypto Currency Platform*
. *Fermat Crypto Commodity Money*
. *Fermat Bank Notes Platform*
. *Fermat Shop Platform*
. *Fermat Cash Money Platform*
. *Fermat Bank Money Platform*
. *Fermat Crypto Brokers Platform*
. *Fermat Crypto Distribution Network*

._Digital Assets platforms_
. *Fermat Digital Assets Platform*
. *Fermat Marketing Platform*

._Accessory services_
. *Fermat Distributed Private Network*

Would you like to see the first tangible use of the supporting infrastructure of Fermat ? We invite you in next chapter to meet the _Wallet Production & Distribution Line_.
