<h3 id="_what_is_fermat">What is Fermat?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is a <strong>trust-less financial application framework</strong>, which contains a Multi-Digital-Wallet system that handles both <em>crypto currencies</em> and <em>digital assets</em> . It allows non-developers to create their own digital wallets or trust-less financial applications reusing or combining other wallets or wallet components built into the system as plugins. It also holds a P2P network for transporting meta-data and inter-connecting clients one to the other.<br>
Fermat is a set of services facing the end user and based on the existing blockchain protocols.<br>
In order to bridge the existing gap between the underlying crypto technology and the end user, Fermat offers a first layer of <em>reference wallets</em> that are developed to address different use cases, one per wallet.<br>
A second layer of <em>niche wallets</em> combine reference wallets functionalities and add their own touch.<br>
This both enables a third layer of <strong><em>branded wallets</em></strong> that can be generated just by changing the look and feel and navigation structure of niche wallets without the need of a developer.<br>
The goal is to allow any company big or small, brand or institution to have their own digital wallet with <strong>any</strong> subset of the whole functionality built for the entire user community.+
Fermat&#8217;s architecture includes the possibility of interconnecting the trust-less financial applications developed within its framework to the existent legacy financial system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fermat_community">Fermat Community</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is an Open Source project and there is an active community of developers, designers and academics contributing to it. The project&#8217;s maintainer community is bitDubai, a joint venture of some of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project started on August 2014 and the early first version of its core was written from January to May 2015 by a handful of people. From there many more developers joined in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today Fermat is a vibrant community spanning several countries and disciplines.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_vision">The Vision</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Fermat Community believe that the next decade will witness <strong>crypto currencies</strong> going mainstream and governments issuing digital currency as well. They expect <strong>paper money</strong> is going to <em>disappear</em> within the next 5 to 10 years. Thus a strong consumer demand for <strong>digital wallets</strong> will inevitably emerge. In order to meet this demand thousands of different wallets should be available, different not only in terms of the level of abstraction they apply (some of them showing crypto currencies while others digital fiat over crypto or even digital assets) but also with respect to their appearance and how they feel to the user, as well as differences in their functionalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Fermat Community is contributing to that future with a System to build and run any kind of digital wallets easily by any developer or even non-developers.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_fermat_s_mission">Fermat&#8217;s Mission</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>To get cryptocurrencies mass adopted as soon as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build the best possible integrated system able to handle the finances of not only all the human world population but also of companies and machines in the context of the IoT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_challenge">The challenge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of Fermat addressed the answers to the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How can the perception of complexity on crypto currencies by ordinary people be isolated?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the collective intelligence of the developer community be used?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can the entire current infrastructure already in place be reused?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can legacy financial institutions be integrated in a way they feel comfortable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can merchants, retailers and brands of all sizes be integrated in a clever way?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can non-developers be allowed to create digital wallets without programming anything at all?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answers to each of these questions are addressed within Fermat.</p>

<h2 id="_chapter_1_fermat_master_plan">Chapter 1: Fermat Master Plan</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a Master Plan, Fermat has it&#8217;s own vision of how a collaborative project should be carried out. The main concept is to define a large master plan far into the future, and start building it phase by phase adjusting the target when needed. It is designed in this way to absorb the efforts of thousands of contributors over the years into a unified architectural vision.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the pioneer step of Nakamoto who gave rise to <strong>Bitcoin</strong> and its revolutionary blockchain technology, in the last years, there has been a lot of fin tech investment money given to a myriad of startup initiating in this industry. This fostered the next evolutionary step, <strong>"cryptocurrency 2.0"</strong> but it has still not reached the level of adoption expected. There seems to exist an unbalance between the considerable investment of funds and effort needed to master this technology and the results they are bringing up. What is more, isolated projects trying to build something useful starting form zero point have it difficult to obtain the necessary support and the persistent endurance needed to succeed&#8230;<br>
Precisely acknowledging this weak points in the industry, and choosing <strong>collaboration</strong> within a <strong>master plan</strong> as starting point, it is how the Fermat Community believes to succeed in solving the challenges set in their mission and purpose by building a complete new framework that solves the problem in an efficient, inclusive and attractive way.</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Fermat&#8217;s architecture</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat as a system is built on several overlapping architectural paradigms:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>At a higher level, it is a <strong>Peer to Peer system with asymmetric nodes</strong>, meaning that each node even having all the code base, it specializes itself according to the profile of the end user or the way it was configured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside each node Fermat features a <strong>Multi-OS architecture</strong> meaning that the lowest level OS-dependent components are wrapped in a way that can be easily replaced when running on a different OS without affecting the rest of the components consuming services from them. The up-most components, the ones facing the end user (GUI) are also OS-dependent. Everything in between is <strong>not</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the same time it features a plugins architecture inserted into a <strong>multi-layered structure</strong>. These layers are occasionally grouped into <strong>Superlayers</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These <strong>plug-ins</strong> are subdivided into a hierarchy of <strong>Platforms</strong>. Those <strong>Platforms</strong> shares a common set of layers, and each one adds <strong>Actors</strong> and <strong>Products</strong> to the overall functionality of the Fermat system. Inside each Plug-in, you might find a specialized structure and in many cases a database or files belonging to that plug-in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At a system level, Fermat uses specialized crawlers to collect or sometimes inject information into nodes in order to recreate a system level consciousness prepared to resist attacks or other relevant issues.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_p2p_architecture">p2p architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is a <em>distributed system</em>, it runs on end user&#8217;s devices, so it needs to establish a connection between every actor and every device using it. This is done by creating a <strong>P2P network</strong> between them, based on the services provided by <em>Fermat P2P Network and Communication Superlayer</em>.<br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_multi_os_architecture">multi OS architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat is <strong>code-base portable</strong>, meaning that the components are written in code that runs in different operating systems.
So, through <em>Fermat Operating Systems API Superlayer</em>, the components that are specific to a given Operating System connect to the rest of Fermat that is OS independent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="multilayer">multilayer architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat needs to be adaptable, to provide highly component reutilization, and to offer a scalability that match the complexity of the services that are running on it. Therefore the components are set in <strong>layers</strong> stacking one over the other. Each layer groups components that provide a similar functionality, eg. communications layer is designed to provide a way to connect one device to another building a "communications channel" using different available technologies ( cloud servers, wifi, NFT, etc), and in performing this task, it let other components from other layers do their specific task consuming services of this communication layer in a transparent way (without any concern on how the communication is actually being established).<br>
There are certain <strong>Layers</strong> that provide services at a system-wide scale (see <strong>superlayers</strong>), but other layers are defined within one <strong>platform</strong> and serve to provide its set of specific functionalities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_plug_ins_architecture">plug-ins architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Plug-ins</strong> have an outstanding feature: as long as their INTERFACE (i.e. the shape of the interconnection) is known and public, the plug-in can interact with others, consuming and offering services, INDEPENDENTLY of its inner structure and how it is built. As long as they conserve this INTERFACE, they can safely evolve to more efficient functioning WITHOUT altering a single service that has been built upon it !
Inside Fermat, each plug-in is given certain specific responsibility within the whole, it lives in a certain layer, and it is allowed to consume services of components on <em>lower layers</em> and to provide services to components of <em>upper layers</em>. Plug-ins participate in high level processes and they are programmed in a way to live in an uncontrolled environment (end user devices) and to co-exist with untrusted third party plug-ins as well.
Through this, Fermat is able to connect and reuse most of the infrastructure deployed by the industry.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_platform_architecture">platform architecture</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>platform</strong> consists of a group of components living in different <strong>layers</strong> interconnected to offer a specific set of services for a discovered niche. For example, if we address to cryptocurrency users, we will need a <em>cryptocurrency wallet</em> for each cryptocurrency available running on <em>Fermat Crypto Currency Platform</em>. This wallet would operate on the selected cryptonetwork by means of a connection to it provided by the <em>Blockchain Platform</em>, and will interact with the user by means of an <strong>desktop</strong> living in the OS specific layers.</p>

The platform first defines a <em>plug-in identity</em> for each plug-in (this is done only ONCE for the whole system), which let the plug-in be <strong>recognized</strong> as member of Fermat and then access to certain data specifically owned by it (like accessing to the file system or data base systems, etc). Then it put them to run ( see [system initialization] ) and builds the pattern of relationships between the isolated plug-ins, thus deploying all the system wide infrastructure.<br>
Fermat Core Platform is written in JAVA as the most of Fermat, and that there is a JAVA implementation for each known operating system, that makes Fermat <strong>code base portable</strong>.<br>

It might be useful to recall in this section a basic concept in blockchain technology about Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets.
These Wallets are created in a way that they generate a <strong>master private key</strong> and taking this key as a <strong>parent branch</strong> of a derivation tree, a complete set of <strong>children</strong> keys might be derived from it in a hierarchical deterministic manner. This enables the creation of a very large number of children private keys to sign transactions and children public key to obtain valid cryptoaddress from them -with the usual procedure of applying a <em>hash function</em>- which allow the derived wallets created in the system to properly operate with them <em>without</em> revealing the <strong>master key</strong>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <strong><em>multilayer architecture</em></strong> reveals useful when grouping the plugins according to their common functionalities. This gives , on one hand, a certain order and structure to the system and lets identify common challenges to solve when writing code. On the other hand, the conceptual strength of using <em>layers</em> stimulate the creation of future plugins that are revealed as necessary when decomposing a big task in smaller steps to solve and implement. What&#8217;s more, plugins that are originally conceived to serve a certain function, afterwards appear to be reusable for new developments beyond their initial purpose.<br>
We have already explored in the previous sections the main role of the <strong>Core Platform</strong> to deploy the whole system structure, and the first available services provided by the system-wide <strong><em>superlayers</em></strong> .<br>
Now, let us explore the next <strong><em>layers</em></strong> following on top, which are almost present in every <strong><em>Fermat platform</em></strong> which follows.<br>
<strong>Layers</strong> are built with a considerable atomicity in its components (i.e. each component deals with a very specific and constrained set of events) what really renders the whole Fermat system with a strong, structured and solid foundation and at the same time a large flexibility and adaptability for further development and evolution.<br></p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_platform_services_layer_em">1.1. <em>Platform Services layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The modules in this layer handle the very basic tasks that allow plugins interact safely in and uncontrolled environment, taking care of a careful transmission of responsibility from one component to another and specially the management of exceptions and track of all system&#8217;s <strong>events</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="__em_network_service_layer_em">1.2. <em>Network Service layer</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each time that a certain system function must perform any operation <strong>outside</strong> the device where Fermat is running, a <em>network service</em> is required to follow the execution in other devices until is completed.<br>
Network services' modules need to have a <strong>communication channel</strong> established and maintained between the parties involved, what is done by the <strong>Fermat network</strong> <br>
Each <strong>network service module</strong> running on a <em>local device</em> establishes communication EXCLUSIVELY to its <em>counterpart</em> running in the <em>remote device</em>.<br>
The module handles a table of request and responses to communicate with the counterpart and so perform the required task.<br></p>

<h2 id="_chapter_9_fermat_wallet_production_distribution_line">Chapter 9: Fermat Wallet Production &amp; Distribution Line</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat builds the necessary services to run a wallet application at a user level collecting different functionalities available. Each functionality has its own work-flow, i.e the thread connecting the plug-ins from different layers to complete the task.<br>
First group of functionalities are wrapped in the <strong>reference wallets</strong>, which are designed to fulfill only a specific objective.<br>
<strong>Niche wallets</strong> are built combining a set of <strong>reference wallets</strong> to satisfy the specific needs of a certain type of <strong>actor</strong>.<br>
* For example, Fermat <em>Bitcoin Wallet</em> is the niche wallet of the <em>Crypto Currency Platform</em>, designed for those actors that only require a wallet to manage their value in <strong>Bitcoins</strong> without further complexity. This is based on the <em>Crypto Wallet</em> as reference wallet, which in turns sets in motion  the specific work-flows to fulfill its duties.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside a wallet, there are two distinct groups of the components:<br>
* components oriented towards the user (what he sees and how he manages the wallet), called <strong>front-end</strong> components.<br>
* components that perform each function of the wallet at operational level, called <strong>back-end</strong> components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fermat provides a <em>Wallet Manager application</em> to install available wallets in the user&#8217;s device, collecting from the distributed network, the necessary front-end components (wallet&#8217;s <em>navigation structure</em> and wallet&#8217;s <em>resources</em>) and activating the dormant back-end components built-in the Fermat implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fermat_wallet_factory">Fermat Wallet Factory</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once we have at least one <strong>Niche Wallet</strong> (e.g.<strong>Bitcoin Reference Wallet</strong>), we can realize that in the <strong>front-end</strong> there are two distinct tasks taking place: on one hand, there exist a <strong>navigation structure</strong> (available menus, tabs, buttons, etc) that provides the means by which the user operates the wallet, an on the other hand, there exists a set of <strong>resources</strong> (multimedia files, images, etc) used for the visualization of each element of the wallet.
At the <strong>back-end</strong> , where the real action is occurring, we have a lot of components acting to provide the necessary functions, like:<br></p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>sending and receiving the cryptocurrency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>keeping track of the balance of the wallet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>managing the contacts ( register, identification, etc)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone having the required programmer&#8217;s skills wants to build a wallet in the traditional way in the industry (i.e. without using Fermat), he would necessary have to build every and each one of the components needed for the wallet to run writing the code from zero. However, <em>Fermat Wallet Factory</em> enables developers to take any of the available <strong>niche wallets</strong> to reutilizes its COMPLETE back-end (all the programming code stuff!), and concentrate his endeavor only to the <strong>front-end</strong> making his job a lot easier and allowing all his creativity to be channeled in a better and more attractive result for the end user. (not only for a nice look but also for improved and more efficient functionalities!).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_inside_the_wallet_factory">Inside the Wallet Factory</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step to create a wallet is to join Fermat an get an identification as <strong>plug-in developer</strong>.
Then, by login into the <em>Wallet Factory application</em> he choses a <strong>reference niche wallet</strong> to import, gives his wallet&#8217;s project a new name and saves it as a new WFP-file (WALLET FACTORY PROJECT FILE).<br>
Once in his <strong>own project</strong> he will re-define the <strong>navigation structure</strong> and then he will assign which <strong>wallet resources</strong> he will choose to give his wallet an unique appearance.<br>
The last step is to run the project and test how it works until he is satisfied with the result.<br>
To give birth the new wallet into the world, he will have to <strong>publish</strong> it using <em>Fermat Wallet Publisher</em></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fermat_wallet_publisher">Fermat Wallet Publisher</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Wallet Publisher takes the new wallet designed and held into a WFP-file and <strong>publish</strong> it in the <em>Wallet Store</em> and by this, it becomes available to the rest of the Fermat community to use it.<br>
The publisher is also responsible of notifying the release of new updates for each version or upgrades to new versions of existing wallets.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fermat_wallet_store">Fermat Wallet Store</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Wallet Store component is inside Fermat a DAPP (Distributed Application), i.e. and undetermined amount of nodes collaborate between them to provide the functionality of the application inside the whole system.<br>
The Wallet Store functions in a similar way of known app-stores, and it serves to show the user the wallet that may be attractive to him. It is a <strong>distributed catalog</strong> of wallets.<br>
When one new wallet is chosen, the Wallet Store notifies the Wallet Manager to make it available to the user.<br>
Internally, the Wallet Store  keeps the identity of the wallet, of its developer, and of the resources used by it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Monetary transactions in Fermat are handled separating the <strong>transport of value</strong> (that follows an specific <em>work-flow</em>) from the accountancy of the money, and this all is separated from the transmission of the additional information of the transaction ( the meta data ).<br>
Usually transactions start in specialized plug-ins of one of the transaction layers, an the work-flow&#8217;s chain of actions reach to different levels, from consuming services of the lower layers such as the <em>Blockchain superlayer</em> to connect with the <strong>crypto networks</strong>, to the high level GUI components. The process interacts with Fermat&#8217;s <em>vaults</em> in the <em>Crypto Currency Platform</em> to record the value, and contacts the <strong>wallet</strong> component to do the accountancy.<br>
The rest of the information of the transacting not related to the value, is transmitted through the different <em>network services</em> through the Fermat Network which allow this <strong>meta data</strong> reach the GUI components and be displayed to the end user in a comprehensive way.<br>
This starts in the originating device and then both flows - value and meta data - meet at the recipients device activating the counterpart plug-ins to record everything accordingly and validate the transaction.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Digital Asset is a digital representation of a product or service that can be obtained in exchange of the asset. Another way of saying this, is that it is a representation of something of value that comes with a "right to use" for the assets possessor. ( The asset can be <strong>redeemed</strong> and the end user gets the product or service represented by it)<br>
To create a digital asset two main components are needed:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">the asset meta-data </dt>
<dd>
<p>a set of information of what is represented by the asset and the conditions attached to it (<strong>asset contract</strong>)</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">the validation code </dt>
<dd>
<p>a method that proofs that the asset is genuine and that it cannot be duplicated or forged+
Fermat incorporates the management of Digital Assets over crypto, being the crypto component what ensures it authenticity among other very useful features granted by using blockchain technology.<br>
The application of Digital Assets is as wide as the digital world. There are some assets types that are familiar and some that sound like sci-fi.<br></p>

<p>In the actual stage of development of the crypto currency industry, there is still a very restraint availability of crypto currency due to the reduced circulation regarding the transaction volume and the number of actors involved in the business. Fermat implementation brings to the market a lot of tools and products to facilitate the exchange of crypto currencies in various ways. A key point in building a crypto distribution network is the role of the cryptobrokers whose business logic is straightforward the constant selling of crypto and fiat money. However, to extend the cryptobroker activities to a larger network of interactions that can build a <strong>local</strong> circulation of crypto currencies, the functionalities covered by the previous <em>Crypto Brokers Platform</em> are not sufficient. This new platform adds what is necessary to achieve this goal.<br>
There is a new set of circuits where the crypto and fiat money flow, and several complexities to be taken into account. The new components not only serve to deal with this new interactions but also motivates the adoption of new roles for the different actors stimulating a web of interconnections where value is always being transmitted within a local environment of end users. Thus, a regional crypto ecosystem is created!</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_greek_origins">Greek origins</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pythagoras had to pay his first student to convince him to study with him. He gave him three oboli (about a penny) per lesson until one day he said there was no more money. The student replied that he preferred to pay, provided that they continued with the lessons. The rumor ran through the Greek islands and so the Pythagorean School, also known as the Secret Brotherhood, a philosophical / religious monastic order counting 300 members, was formed. By then counting and calculating had been widely practiced by the Babylonians and Egyptians but the Pythagoreans went far beyond that. “All is Number” was their motto attesting to their conviction that numbers were the key to life itself. Pythagoras strongly believed that relationships between numbers could reveal, through logical demonstration, all the secrets of the universe, hence he started producing his theorems. The Brotherhood walked briskly with his theorems but did nothing to share the secrets of the universe arousing the ire of the people who one day set the school on fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Despite the desperate attempt of his students to save him Pythagoras himself died in the fire. The Brotherhood was dispersed until Alexander the Great founded Alexandria and in order to attract scholars to the new city he took the advice of his general, Ptolemy: “Gather the great books; great minds will follow.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the Library of Alexandria was established with the overall aim of collecting every book ever written. Each traveler had their books confiscated upon arrival to Alexandria. They would be handed over to scribes, who made a copy for the owner and sent the original to the library. The extensive collection comprising 500,000 volumes made Alexandria the intellectual capital of the ancient world and as Ptolemy had envisaged attracted the most famous scholars of the era.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Euclid was put in charge of the math section and by inventing the “reductio ad absurdum” that is the proof by contradiction he took the findings of Pythagoras one step further. Anything that would defy logic seemed abominable to Pythagoras and as such was dismissed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though the Pythagoreans had discovered irrational numbers (pi, or the square root of two) such was their fear of the “unutterable” numbers that their study was immediately forbidden and the disciple who came up with the concept of the “square root of two” was executed. Euclid announced to everyone that Pythagoras was abominable and advocated that irrational numbers would open a new door for mathematics and as such encouraged them to think about them without fear.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_first_peer_to_peer_network">The First Peer to Peer Network</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Julius Caesar’s attack on Alexandria marked the demise of the Royal Library as it was burnt down in a devastating fire and the invaluable collection of scrolls was reduced to ashes. In an attempt to win Cleopatra’s heart Mark Antony bought the entire Library of Pergamos, which had been second only to the Great Library of Alexandria, and presented the 200,000 volumes to Cleopatra. By having done so, Alexandria continued to boast the greatest library in the world until its eradication by Islamic troops entering the city in the 7th century under the leadership of Caliph Omar. The Caliph ordered the destruction of all books on account of either opposing the Koran, which was considered to be heresy or for being superfluous. For years the water of the public baths of Alexandria was heated using those books to feed the fire. Mathematicians learned their lesson: in order not to disappear the Brotherhood expanded to everywhere without having a center but its members continued keeping in close contact with each other. This marked the beginning of the mathematical tradition of sharing every doubt, every finding and every gossip with the near and distant colleagues (they tell feedback). Should we call it the first and oldest peer to peer network?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Soon two separate branches of mathematics i.e., applied mathematics and number theory began to evolve dividing the mathematician community. Those more intrigued by the practical application formed working groups whereas those merely interested in numbers preferred to work alone. Newton accused the representatives of the latter branch of being vulgar ego jugglers, who had been wasting their time teasing each other with riddles which lacked concrete utility. An ardent supporter of that school was a judge in Toulouse called Pierre de Fermat, whose greatest pleasure in life was to play with numbers and then to send little notes about his findings to Descartes and Pascal. When it came to mental calculations such were his skills that Fermat had no inclination to spend time putting them in writing claiming that it would halt his reasoning and hated being asked about the intermediate steps. He was solution -rather than demonstration- oriented and found it appealing to be compared to big names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One day he took the famous theorem of Pythagoras (the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the legs) and concluded that the equation has no integer solutions for powers greater than two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“It is impossible for a cube to be the sum of two cubes, a fourth power to be the sum of two fourth powers, or in general for any number that is a power greater than the second to be the sum of two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this margin is too narrow to contain.” he scribbled in the margin of his copy of the ancient Greek text Arithmetica by Diophantus thereby creating one of the most notable puzzles in mathematics driving many mathematicians to insanity until proven three hundred and fifty years later.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_prize">The Prize</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first two hundred and fifty years it was a puzzle merely for young mathematicians who immediately abandoned it as soon as they had arrived to the conclusion, previously drawn by Gauss, that solving this puzzle would not contribute to the progress of mathematics. It was toward the end of the nineteenth century that a German amateur mathematician Paul Wolfskehl struck by love sickness was on the verge of committing suicide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While waiting for the stroke of midnight to shoot himself in the head he passed the time reading about the latest progress in solving Fermat’s Last Theorem. Touched by a flash of inspiration he began working on the solution and so lost he became in it that morning found him in his library. Even though his approach failed at last the intricate beauty of number theory once again awakened his desire for life.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The young Wolfskehl turned out to have more talent for business than for pure numbers and over the years he had become a millionaire, however, he never forgot that night. In order to repay the debt he rewrote his will bequeathing 100,000 Marks to the first person who could solve the puzzle. Following his death in 1906 the Wolfskehl Prize was announced fueling public desire to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, which greatly contributed to the progress of number theory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_solution">The Solution</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A mountain of failed attempts to win the prize had been accumulating in the basement of the University of Göttingen, 621 proofs, all flawed had been sent just within the first year of Wolfskehl’s death. By 1993 no serious mathematician would engage in trying to solve the longstanding riddle of Fermat’s Last Theorem, only fans, mostly inmates and lunatics, persisted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then in 1993 it was at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge, the heart of the world of mathematics (a building created with the intention of bringing together the greatest mathematicians for a week each year, a building with not a single private corner, with offices having no doors and with blackboards even in bathrooms and in the elevator) that a freckled Englishman announced to his illustrious peers that working fully alone for ten years without the aid of a computer he had solved Fermat’s Theorem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Returning from his classes at Princeton University he would sat alone at the table, sometimes even twelve hours, a piece of paper lying in front of him every so often scribbling a formula like the old Fermat did. However, unlike Fermat he diligently noted down not only each and every formula but their endless development also.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mathematicians say their specialty is an archipelago of small certainties scattered in a sea of ignorance. The real advances in mathematics are made when the bridges connecting these islands are built. In his dissertation Andrew Wiles established so many bridges that the entire history of mathematics could be reconstructed based on that, and that is exactly what the Hindu Simon Singh did by writing his beautiful book entitled Fermat’s Last Theorem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All representatives of number theory are enumerated in that book, however, the most remarkable of all is an unnamed colleague, who when facing Wiles as he was triumphantly leaving the stage addressed him with undisguised obfuscation: “And now that you have taken away the problem, what are you going to give us in return?”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_new_problem">The New Problem</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The secret of Fermat’s Last Theorem had been deciphered at last, however, even as of today the world is abundant in puzzles, which despite the tremendous advances in technology, are still waiting to be solved. All my adult life I seem to have been attracted to problems the complexity of which would deter even the most enthusiastic experts of the field. Inspired by the difficulty of the task I have always managed to rise to the challenge and sparing no time and energy succeeded in unraveling the mystery surrounding it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After having designed mission critical systems for banks for more than a decade, I found myself in the United Arab Emirates establishing a techno-artistic startup called Nomad Inception boasting a technology which besides having enabled the automated creation of non repetitive Islamic geometric patterns on a scale never seen before also paved the way for new original non repetitive patterns for the first time in five hundred years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Being Argentinean I have absolutely no relation to the Arabic culture, however, my fascination with the amazing intricacy and sophistication of Islamic geometric patterns helped me grasp the secrets of a traditional art form mastered by a handful of artisans only. Solving a thousand-year-old historical puzzle and thereby potentially contributing to the preservation of our cultural heritage is a vastly rewarding experience worth all the effort invested in it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was in Dubai, where I was setting up my company, that I first learned about bitcoin and having spotted the excellent opportunity my new mission conceived. This era has witnessed the digitalization of music and images. By solving the “problem of double spending” i.e., preventing a digital item to be sent to multiple people more than once, the last obstacle to the digitalization of money was eliminated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was in 2008 that crypto-currencies were first introduced, however, while the CD player and the digital camera have already conquered the world by enabling the wide-spread use of the inventions which called them to life, the technology equivalent to these designed to facilitate the mass conversion of users of paper money to users of digital money is yet to be created. Creation of such a technology is the new problem to solve.  The problem is as complex as it can be, as 6 years have passed and some hundreds of millions of dollars of venture capital has been poured into start-ups working in this space since the solution for the double spending problem was found.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We suspect the solution involves finding the islands not yet discovered and building bridges to connect them both with each other and with the entire current archipelago.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_divine_sign">Divine Sign</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I delved into studying the problem with newfound enthusiasm, however, my commitments at Nomad Inception prevented me from devoting all my attention to finding the solution until a business meeting changed my life forever.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am anything but superstitious, however, it goes without saying that the question a potential business partner asked me upon receipt of my business card, on which the word “inception” in Arabic appeared as company logo, could only be interpreted as a divine sign compelling me to leave Nomad Inception without further delay and turn all my attention to find the solution for this modern day Fermat’s problem. You may wonder what the life-changing question was…</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Have you been aware that the word ‘inception’ in Arabic used as your logo would read ‘bitcoin’ just by adding one dot to it?”</p>

<h3 id="_what_s_behind_money">What&#8217;s behind money?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our daily live we have accepted money as something present in almost every activity of human endeavor, and most of us use it without reflecting on its origin or its deeper meaning. Making it simple, money is an agreed mean of exchanging value. By its universal adoption it allows a flow of products and services between the different actors in a producer-consumer chain ( or better, in a "web" of commercial interactions) and following this, an exchange of the value associated with each step, rewarding each actor with a portion of the entire value, what we call "profit".
During the early ages trading was made directly exchanging certain goods for other goods, then as trading was growing at scale, the necessity of unification of mass and measures lead to the rising of money representing in some way the value of what was being exchange and a relative consensus over it. Later on, with the rising of the different nations which created a certain unification under certain name, language and government and rules to be applied to a determined territory and its inhabitants, this nations extended their sovereignty also to the issue of a national currency and the printing of "official" paper money. At the beginning the amount of paper money was guaranteed by a national reserve on gold, but most of government abandoned the <strong>gold standard</strong> after the 1930 world crisis, and after 1971 the US government severed definitely the link between US Dollar to gold. This means, that the current money we use only depends on the "trust" we deposit on the government that rules its emission and this "legal curse" is enforced by law. There is NOT ANY OTHER intrinsic property on paper money to ensure its value than this!! When talking about corruption in some of our political and financial institutions, we can easily perceive how often this trust has been abused. This kind of money enforced by law which value is not linked to any specific asset has been called <strong>fiat money</strong>.</p>

<p>When Bitcoin solved the issues that prevented other digital currencies to become a viable <em>digital money</em> ( <strong>authenticity</strong> of the issuing and ownership and the <strong>"double-spend"</strong> problem) it opened a whole new world in financial systems and economy, where cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user&#8217;s claim to value. So, this new kind of currency that is entirely virtual and that is implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient based on cryptographic signatures is what we call <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>.</p>

The undeniable achievement of Bitcoin&#8217;s electronic signature protocol based on <strong>cryptography</strong> is the creation of a distributed public ledger of peer-to-peer electronic transactions that is transparent and at the same time preserves the anonymity and the security needed to become a safe way of transporting <strong>value</strong>, based on <strong>consensus agreement</strong>. This technology opens the door to a new paradigm in economics, computer science, financial operations, and world-wide commerce.<br>
Nakamoto&#8217;s invention makes possible to unveil the world of financial transactions, to get rid of the necessity of <strong>trust</strong> into a third party institution or central governments, to make money a secure thing, and transactions transparent and effortless. It returns to the money&#8217;s owner the absolute control over his richness.<br>
This <strong>trust-less</strong> (or <strong>trust-free</strong>) cryptocurrency scheme encourages us to adopt a radical new point of view on money and the concept of value itself and its transport, so radical, that it will take us  time and effort to really grasp it, because it leads to the unconditionally honoring and empowering of each individual.

Taking Bitcoin as "the" paradigmatic model of every cryptocurrency, we need to have in mind that for Bitcoin to exist following is needed:<br>
* A decentralized peer-to-peer network (the bitcoin protocol)<br>
* A public transaction ledger (the blockchain)<br>
* A decentralized mathematical and deterministic currency issuance (distributed mining)<br>
* A decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script)<br>
