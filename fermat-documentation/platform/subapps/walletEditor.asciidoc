[[Platform-SubApps-WalletEditor]]
= Wallet Editor

This subapp let an actor take any wallet in the <<Platform-SubApps-WalletStore,wallet store>> and edit it. The subapp is focused to marketing agencies. +
Here edition means that the subapp will take the navigation structure of the selected wallet from the wallet runtime and copy it to what we will call a wallet editor project. +
Basically, the edition let the actor change the navigation structure and user interface, but it doesn't let you change the wallet business logic.

This editor let the actors change the resources settled by the <<Platform-SubApps-WalletFactory,wallet factory>> and basically make a fork of the wallet. +

Following the life cycle, this project will be taken by a particular brand before the publishing of the wallet.
