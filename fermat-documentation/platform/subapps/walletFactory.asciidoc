[[Platform-SubApps-WalletFactory]]
= Wallet Factory

This subapp is focused in developers, it lets a user edit the navigation structure of a wallet and create what we call a wallet factory project. +
This projects will be managed by a subapp called <<Platform-SubApps-WalletPublisher,Wallet Publisher>>.

When a user edit a wallet he can set (add) the resources (like images) the wallet use. +
Those resources are not saved in the wallet runtime but are referenced using the wallet resources plug-in. +

When the wallet manager install a new wallet it ask the corresponding resources to the wallet resources plug-in. +

At this moment the resources are stored in a github repository associated to each wallet. In the future we plan to avoid the necessity of a central point of reference to download resources and to have them distributed over the platform's users.
