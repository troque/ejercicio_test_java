#This script automatically generates all the issues necessary for the implementation of a fermat plug-in.
######
#INSTALL AND RUN
######
#To achieve this objective, this script uses python-github3, which is used to handle the github api from python.
#To install python-github3 in GNU/Linux you may need to install the Python Package Index, please use this command:
#	sudo apt-get install python-pip
#Now you need to install the github api python library:
#	pip install pygithub3
#To run this script in the ubuntu shell, please, run this command:
#	python $SCRIPT_PATH/issuesGenerator.py
######
#CONFIGURATION
######
#Please, configure your script to generate all the issues following the next steps:
#	1) Set the platform var: this represents the plug-in platform.
#	2) Set the layer var: this represents the plug-in layer.
#	3) Set the pluginName var: this represents the plug-in name, please use capital characters in the first character on every word.
#	4) Set the githubLogin var: this represents your login user in github.
#	5) Set the githubPassword var: this represents your login password in github.
#	6) Set the repository var: this represents the target repository.
#	7) Set the teamLeaderGithubUser var: this represent the responsible or team leader that approves your pull-requests.
#	8) Adjust the public interfaces list: you can add any element according the plug-in structure.
#	9) Adjust the internal clases list: you can add any element according the plug-in structure.
